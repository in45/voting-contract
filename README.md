## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Install Vyper**:
   You can install Vyper using pip:
```bash
   pip install vyper
```
## Compile the Contract
1. Save the contract code in a file named Voting.vy.
2. Compile the Vyper contract to EVM bytecode using the Vyper compiler:

```bash
vyper Voting.vy -f json > Voting.json
```
## Deploy the Contract
Deploy the compiled contract using a tool like Remix IDE, Truffle, or directly with a web3 library such as web3.py. Hereâ€™s a brief guide for deployment using Remix IDE:
1. Open Remix IDE.
2. Create a new file and paste the contract code into it.
3. Select the Vyper compiler from the compiler tab and compile the contract.
4. Deploy the contract using the `Deploy` button in the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.

## Interact with the Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using the provided functions:

1. Cast a Vote:
Call the vote function with the candidate's name:
